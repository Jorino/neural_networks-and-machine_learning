# Neural Networks and Machine Learning
This repository consists of machine learning projects done with python.

# Thesis
<br>The aim of the study was to examine the possibility of using a neural network model to predict stroke from a dataset. This report introduces stroke and the risk factors involved. Focus is also on neural networks in general and the technologies used for processing the data and creating the neural network models.

<br>The project was done using the Python programming language. Relevant Python libraries here are TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Jupyter Notebook editor was used for creating and documenting the program.

<br>The technologies used in the project are introduced in this report, including the relevant Python libraries and the tools they provide for data science and machine learning projects.

<br>During the project, several different neural network models were tried and tested. For the final evaluation two structurally different models were, a simple neural network model and a more complex model.

<br>The results achieved with the models are explored and evaluated. The evaluation of the models was done by observing the prediction accuracies and the values of the loss function.

## Neural networks for health technology applications

### Case 1:
<br>Target is to create a model for predicting whether a person has a heart disease or not.

### Case 2: 
<br>Goal is to use a convolutional neural network model to analyze X-ray images of lungs and find out if the person has pneumonia or not.

### Case 3:
<br>Target is to analyze drug review texts and predict the corresponding rating for the drug the user has given.

## Various machine learning projects

Clustering, Decision tree, Linear regression, Logistic Regression and Recommendation engine folders are small projects utilizing different methods of machine learning.
