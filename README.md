## Neural networks for health technology applications

Case 1:
<br>Target is to create a model for predicting whether a person has a heart disease or not.

Case 2: 
Goal is to use a convolutional neural network model to analyze X-ray images of lungs and find out if the person has pneumonia or not.

Case 3:
Target is to analyze drug review texts and predict the corresponding rating for the drug the user has given.
